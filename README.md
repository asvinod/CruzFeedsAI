# CruzFeedsAI (WORK IN PROGRESS)
CruzFeedsAI is a web application designed to personalize meal plans based on the UCSC Dining Halls. Utilizing BeautifulSoup4, we web scrape the dining hall nutritional information, filter this information based on user selections, and provide this information as a prompt for Google's Gemini Developer API to generate healthy meal options. 

Next steps:
1. Provide clean display for generated meal options
2. Create loading screen between meal option generation and display
3. Host website
