# CruzFeedsAI
CruzFeedsAI is a web application designed to personalize meal plans based on the UCSC Dining Halls. This application takes into account user's dining hall choice, meal option, and dietary restrictions to generate healthy meal options, prompted to and generated by Google's Gemini API. The dining hall information is web scraped and saved into CSV files, in which we use polars to then filter the data based on the selections by the user.
