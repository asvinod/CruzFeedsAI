# CruzFeedsAI (WORK IN PROGRESS)
CruzFeedsAI is a web application designed to personalize meal plans based on the UCSC Dining Halls. Utilizing BeautifulSoup4, the dining hall information (https://nutrition.sa.ucsc.edu/) is webscraped, filter this information based on user selections, and provide this information as a prompt for Google's Gemini Developer API to generate healthy meal options. 

Next steps:
1. Provide clean display for generated meal options
2. Host website
